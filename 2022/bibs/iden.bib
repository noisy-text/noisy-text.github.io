    abstract = "Twitter is an excellent source of data for NLP researches as it offers tremendous amount of textual data. However, processing tweet to extract meaningful information is very challenging, at least for two reasons: (i) using nonstandard words as well as informal writing manner, and (ii) code-mixing issues, which is combining multiple languages in single tweet conversation. Most of the previous works have addressed both issues in isolated different task. In this study, we work on normalization task in code-mixed Twitter data, more specifically in Indonesian-English language. We propose a pipeline that consists of four modules, i.e tokenization, language identification, lexical normalization, and translation. Another contribution is to provide a gold standard of Indonesian-English code-mixed data for each module.",
